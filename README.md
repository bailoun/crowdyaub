1. Project Overview
Crowdyaub.com is a web application designed to monitor crowd levels across various locations on the AUB campus in real time. Leveraging the universityâ€™s Wi-Fi network, it provides students and faculty with valuable information about crowd density, helping them make informed decisions about where to go on campus. This project addresses the problem of overcrowded spaces, making campus navigation smoother and reducing wait times in congested areas.

2. Installation
